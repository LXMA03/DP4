EduTrack.swift

We noticed many young teens spend hours on their smartphones, so we developed an application to help combat the issue.
Our app is designed to have users engage and compete with friends/ family in educational challenges to earn points and collect rewards. 
Our goal is to help users spend less time on social media apps and more time on educational apps by incorporating a reward system.

Built with:
  Visual Studio Code
