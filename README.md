We noticed many teens spend hours on their smartphones, primarily for entertainment.

That is why we developed an application to encourage healthier phone habits.

Our app motivates users to engage more with educational apps by competing in fun challenges with friends and family, earning points, and unlocking rewards. 

Our goal is to help users reduce time spent on social media and entertainment apps and increase their focus on educational content through gamified phone usage and a real-life rewards system.
